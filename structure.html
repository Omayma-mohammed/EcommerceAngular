<!-- First of all we have to create a module called shared -->

the structure is ::

<!-- the start of the shared module -->
shared ( module ) => 

    components ( a folder contain all necessary components ) =>
        
        Header ( a component in a folder called Header ) 


    shared ( a service called shared in a folder called services contain all services in our app )    

<!-- the end of the shared module -->


<!-- the start of the products module -->


products ( module ) =>

    components ( a folder called all-components inside it all-products component )

    services  ( a folder called services inside it all necessary services )


<!-- the end of the products module -->    


<!-- the start of the carts module -->


carts ( module ) =>

    components ( a folder called components inside it carts component )

    services  ( a folder called services inside it all necessary services )


<!-- the end of the products module -->    

<!-- كما لاحظنا نستخدم لكل جزء في المشروع موديول خاص به لتسهيل الفهم وسرعة الوصول للملفات -->

<!-- we have to import all modules in the app module to make it works -->

<!-- and after that export all necessary files ( components / services /pipes ... )
     to make it puplic to the whole project
-->
